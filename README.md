# Akto Internship Assignment - Backend Developer

## Overview

This project demonstrates two backend developer assignments completed for the Akto internship. It includes a school management API with Redis-based rate limiting and an API log analyzer service that provides insights from log data.

---

## Log Analysis Implementation (Assignment 2)

### Approach
The log analyzer processes JSON log files to extract meaningful insights about API usage patterns and error rates.

### Features
- **Top Active IPs**: Identifies the 5 most active IP addresses by request count
- **Popular Endpoints**: Lists the 5 most frequently accessed API endpoints
- **Error Tracking**: Counts 5xx server errors by endpoint for monitoring
- **Summary Statistics**: Provides total log count and structured output

### Technical Implementation
- Reads JSON log file using Node.js fs/promises
- Uses Map data structure for efficient counting and aggregation
- Sorts results by frequency for meaningful insights
- Returns structured JSON response for API consumption

### Sample Log Analysis Output
```json
{
  "topIPs": [
    { "ip": "192.168.1.100", "count": 45 },
    { "ip": "10.0.0.50", "count": 32 }
  ],
  "topEndpoints": [
    { "endpoint": "/api/users", "count": 120 },
    { "endpoint": "/api/orders", "count": 85 }
  ],
  "error5xxByEndpoint": [
    { "endpoint": "/api/orders", "error_5xx_count": 5 },
    { "endpoint": "/api/payments", "error_5xx_count": 2 }
  ],
  "totalLogs": 1000
}
```

## API Endpoints

### School Management APIs (Assignment 1)

#### 1. Add School

* **URL:** `/api/school/addSchool`
* **Method:** `POST`
* **Rate Limit:** 3 requests per minute per IP
* **Payload:** JSON body with fields:
  * `name` (string, required)
  * `address` (string, required)
  * `latitude` (float, required)
  * `longitude` (float, required)
* **Function:** Validates input and inserts a new school record in the database.

#### 2. List Schools

* **URL:** `/api/school/listSchools`
* **Method:** `GET`
* **Rate Limit:** 3 requests per minute per IP
* **Query Parameters:**
  * `latitude` (float, required)

    { "endpoint": "/api/orders", "error_5xx_count": 5 }
  ],
  "totalLogs": 1000
}
```

## Rate Limiting Implementation

### Approach
This API implements a **sliding window rate limiter** using Redis as the backing store. The rate limiter:

- Tracks requests per IP address
- Uses a sliding time window (default: 1 minute)
- Allows a maximum number of requests per window (default: 3)
- Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit is exceeded
- Provides standard rate limit headers in responses

### Technical Details
- **Store**: Redis with `rate-limit-redis` adapter
- **Window**: Configurable sliding window (default: 60 seconds)
- **Limit**: Configurable per-IP request limit (default: 3 requests)
- **Headers**: Standard rate limiting headers included in responses
- **Persistence**: Rate limit data persists across server restarts

### Rate Limit Response
When rate limit is exceeded:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Too many requests, please try again later."
}
```

## Distance Calculation

The distance between the user's coordinates and each school's coordinates is calculated using the **Haversine formula**, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere based on their latitudes and longitudes.

### Formula Summary:

```js
const R = 6371; // Earth's radius in kilometers

const dLat = toRad(lat2 - lat1);
const dLon = toRad(lon2 - lon1);

const a =
  Math.sin(dLat / 2) ** 2 +
  Math.cos(toRad(lat1)) * Math.cos(toRad(lat2)) * Math.sin(dLon / 2) ** 2;

const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1 - a));

const distance = R * c; // distance in kilometers
```

* `toRad(value)` converts degrees to radians.
* The result is the distance in **kilometers** between two geo points.
* This distance is used to sort schools by proximity to the user's location.

---

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set up MySQL database:**
   - Create a MySQL database
   - Update `.env` with your database credentials

3. **Set up Redis:**
   - Install and start Redis server
   - Update `.env` with your Redis configuration

4. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy the environment template above to `.env`
   - Update all values according to your setup

5. **Start the server:**
```bash
node index.js
```

6. **Test the APIs:**
   
   **Add a school:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/school/addSchool \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Test School",
       "address": "123 Main St",
       "latitude": 40.7128,
       "longitude": -74.0060
     }'
   ```

   **List schools by proximity:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/school/listSchools?latitude=40.7580&longitude=-73.9855"
   ```

## Live Demo

**üåê Live API URL:** https://api-rate-limiter-0cge.onrender.com

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is deployed on Render's free tier, so the server may be asleep. Please make an initial request to wake it up before testing.

### Quick Rate Limiting Test

**Test Log Analysis:** https://api-rate-limiter-0cge.onrender.com/api/logs/analyze-logs

**Test School Rate Limiting:** https://api-rate-limiter-0cge.onrender.com/api/school/listSchools?latitude=40.7128&longitude=-74.0060

**Instructions:**
1. **Log Analysis Test**: Click the log analysis URL above to see API insights
2. **Rate Limiting Test**: Click the school API URL above 4 times quickly
   - First 3 requests should return school data
   - 4th request should return HTTP 429 (rate limit exceeded)
   - Wait 1 minute and try again - it should work

---

## Testing Rate Limiting

### Local Testing
To test the rate limiting functionality locally:

1. Make 3 requests quickly to any endpoint
2. The 4th request within the same minute will return HTTP 429
3. Wait for the time window to reset and try again

Example using curl (localhost):
```bash
# These should succeed
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/school/addSchool -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"School1","address":"Address1","latitude":40.7128,"longitude":-74.0060}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/school/addSchool -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"School2","address":"Address2","latitude":40.7129,"longitude":-74.0061}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/school/addSchool -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"School3","address":"Address3","latitude":40.7130,"longitude":-74.0062}'

# This should return HTTP 429
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/school/addSchool -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"School4","address":"Address4","latitude":40.7131,"longitude":-74.0063}'
```

### Live Demo Testing
Test both assignments on the live server:

**Assignment 1 - Rate Limiting:**
